## SQL BASICS

## Assignment Questions: 

CREATE DATABASE employees;
USE employees;

#Q1 Create a table called employees with the following structure:  emp_id (integer,should not be NULL and should be a primary key),emp_name(text,should not be NULL), age(integer,should have a check constraint to ensure the age is at least 18),email(text,should be unique for each employee),salary(decimal,with a default value of 30,000).Write the SQL query to create the above table with all constraints.
CREATE TABLE employees (
emp_id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, 
emp_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, 
age INT CHECK (age >= 18), 
email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE, 
salary DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 30000);

SELECT * FROM employees; 
INSERT INTO employees( emp_id, emp_name, age, email,salary) VALUES (1,'Shabana', 27,'shab@gmail.com', 30000);
SELECT * FROM employees;

#Q2 Explain the purpose of constraints and how they help maintain data integrity in a database. Provide examples of common types of constraints.
-- Constraints in SQL are rules applied to table columns to ensure data accuracy and reliability. They prevent invalid data from being inserted.
-- Common Types of Constraints:
-- PRIMARY KEY - Ensures uniqueness for each record (e.g., emp_id).
-- FOREIGN KEY - Establishes a relationship between tables.
-- NOT NULL - Ensures that a column cannot have NULL values (e.g., emp_name).
-- UNIQUE - Ensures that all values in a column are distinct (e.g., email).
-- CHECK - Sets conditions for valid values (e.g., age >= 18).
-- DEFAULT - Assigns a default value if none is provided (e.g., salary = 30,000).
-- Constraints help maintain data consistency, prevent duplicates, and enforce business rules.

#Q3 Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.
-- The NOT NULL constraint ensures a column always has a value, preventing NULL values.
-- A Primary Key CANNOT contain NULL values because it uniquely identifies each record in the table. If NULL were allowed, some records would be unidentifiable.

#Q4. Explain the steps and SQL commands used to add or remove constraints on an existing table. Provide an example for both adding and removing a constraint.
-- Letâ€™s assume we have an existing table called products without constraints:
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2)
);
-- Adding a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
-- A PRIMARY KEY ensures each record is unique and cannot be NULL.
SELECT * FROM products;
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (1, 'Laptop', 800.00);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (2, 'Mouse', 20.00);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (1, 'Keyboard', 30.00); 

-- Adding a NOT NULL Constraint
-- To ensure product_name cannot be NULL:

ALTER TABLE products
MODIFY COLUMN product_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL;
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (3, NULL, 100.00);  

-- Adding a UNIQUE Constraint
-- To prevent duplicate product names:

ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_product_name UNIQUE (product_name);

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (4, 'Monitor', 150.00);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (5, 'Monitor', 170.00); 
-- Adding a CHECK Constraint
-- To ensure the price is always greater than 0:

ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT check_price CHECK (price > 0);
INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name, price) VALUES (6, 'Headphones', -50.00); 

-- Adding a DEFAULT Constraint
-- To set the default price as 50.00:

ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

INSERT INTO products (product_id, product_name) VALUES (7, 'Charger');
SELECT * FROM products WHERE product_id = 7;

-- Removing Constraints from an Existing Table
-- Removing a PRIMARY KEY Constraint
ALTER TABLE products
DROP CONSTRAINT pk_product;

-- Removing a NOT NULL Constraint
ALTER TABLE products
MODIFY COLUMN product_name VARCHAR(50) NULL;
-- Now, product_name can accept NULL values.

-- Removing a UNIQUE Constraint
ALTER TABLE products
DROP CONSTRAINT unique_product_name;
-- Now, multiple products can have the same product_name.

-- Removing a CHECK Constraint
ALTER TABLE products
DROP CONSTRAINT check_price;
-- Now, negative prices can be inserted.

-- Removing a DEFAULT Constraint
ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price DROP DEFAULT;
-- Now, inserting a product without a price will result in NULL instead of 50.00.

#Q5 Explain the consequences of attempting to insert, update, or delete data in a way that violates constraints.Provide an example of an error message that might occur when violating a constraint.
-- If an operation violates a constraint, SQL throws an error.

-- Example Errors:
-- Inserting NULL into a NOT NULL column:
SELECT * FROM employees;
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name) VALUES (1, NULL);
-- Error: ERROR: Column 'emp_name' cannot be null

-- Inserting duplicate value in a UNIQUE column:

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, email) VALUES (2, 'John', 'john@email.com');
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, email) VALUES (3, 'Jane', 'john@email.com');
-- Error: ERROR: Duplicate entry 'john@email.com' for key 'email'

-- Inserting a value that violates a CHECK constraint:

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, emp_name, age) VALUES (4, 'Mark', 16);
-- Error: ERROR: Check constraint failed: age must be at least 18
-- Constraints prevent incorrect data from entering the database, ensuring data integrity.

#Q6 you created a products table without constraints as follows:
CREATE TABLE products(
	product_id INT,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    price DECIMAL(10,2));
-- Now,you realise that:
-- The product_id should be a primary key.
-- The price should have a default value of 50.00
SELECT * FROM products;
-- Make product_id a primary key
-- Set a default price of 50.00
ALTER TABLE products
ADD CONSTRAINT pk_product PRIMARY KEY (product_id);

ALTER TABLE products
ALTER COLUMN price SET DEFAULT 50.00;

#Q7 You have two tables:
-- students with columns: student_id, student_name, class_id
-- classes with columns: class_id, class_name
CREATE DATABASE students;
USE students;
SELECT * FROM students;

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    class_id INT
);
-- Step 2: Insert Data into students Table
INSERT INTO students (student_id, student_name, class_id) VALUES 
(1, 'Alice', 101),
(2, 'Bob', 102),
(3, 'Charlie', 101);
-- Step 3: Create the classes Table
CREATE TABLE classes (
    class_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    class_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
SELECT * FROM Classes;
-- Step 4: Insert Data into classes Table
INSERT INTO classes (class_id, class_name) VALUES 
(101, 'Math'),
(102, 'Science'),
(103, 'History');
-- Step 5: Fetch student_name and class_name Using INNER JOIN
SELECT students.student_name, classes.class_name
FROM students
INNER JOIN classes
ON students.class_id = classes.class_id;

    order_date DATE,
    customer_id INT
);
SELECT * FROM Orders;


CREATE TABLE Customers (

    customer_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Customers (customer_id, customer_name) VALUES
(101, 'Alice'),
(102, 'Bob');

CREATE TABLE Productss (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50),
    order_id INT
);

INSERT INTO Productss(product_id, product_name, order_id) VALUES
(1, 'Laptop', 1),
(2, 'Phone', NULL);
-- SQL Query to Get Required Output:
SELECT 
    COALESCE(o.order_id, 'No Order') AS order_id, 
    COALESCE(c.customer_name, 'No Customer') AS customer_name, 
    p.product_name
FROM Productss p
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON p.order_id = o.order_id
LEFT JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id;

-- Explanation:
-- LEFT JOIN ensures all products are included, even those not linked to an order.
-- Orders are joined with customers to fetch customer_name.

-- Q9 Calculate the total sales amount for each product.
-- Table Creation and Data Insertion:
USE employees;
CREATE TABLE Sales (
    sale_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    amount INT
);

INSERT INTO Sales (sale_id, product_id, amount) VALUES
(1, 101, 500),
(2, 102, 300),
(3, 101, 700);
USE employees;
CREATE TABLE Produccts (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO Produccts (product_id, product_name) VALUES
(101, 'Laptop'),
(102, 'Phone');
-- SQL Query to Get Total Sales Amount per Product:
SELECT 
    p.product_name, 
    SUM(s.amount) AS total_sales
FROM Sales s
INNER JOIN Produccts p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name;

    product_id INT,
    quantity INT
);

INSERT INTO Order_Details (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 101, 2),
(1, 102, 1),
(2, 101, 3);
-- SQL Query to Display Order Details:

SELECT 
    o.order_id, 
    c.customer_name, 
    od.product_id,
    od.quantity
FROM Orders o
INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
INNER JOIN Order_Details od ON o.order_id = od.order_id;
-- Explanation:
-- INNER JOIN links Orders with Customers to get customer_name.
-- Another INNER JOIN connects Orders with Order_Details to fetch product_id and quantity.

### NORMALISATION & CTE
USE mavenmovies;

## 1. First Normal Form (1NF)
#Q1. Identify a table in the Sakila database that violates 1NF. Explain how you would normalize it to achieve 1NF.

-- A table violates 1NF if it contains repeating groups or multiple values in a single column.

-- Example: film table with multiple categories in a single column

SELECT film_id, category_id FROM film_category;

-- This table already follows 1NF because it breaks categories into multiple rows.
-- If a table stored multiple categories in a single column like "Action, Comedy", it would violate 1NF.

##2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
#Q2: Choose a table in Sakila and determine whether it is in 2NF. If it violates 2NF, explain how to normalize it.

-- A table violates 2NF if it has partial dependencies, meaning a non-key attribute depends only on part of a composite primary key.

-- Example: film_actor Table

DESC film_actor;

-- It has a composite key (actor_id, film_id). If we added actor_name here, it would violate 2NF because actor_name depends only on actor_id.

-- Fix: Move actor_name to the actor table.

## 3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
#Q3. Identify a table in Sakila that violates 3NF. Describe the transitive dependencies present and outline the steps to normalize it.

-- A table violates 3NF if it has transitive dependencies, meaning a non-key column depends on another non-key column instead of the primary key.

-- Example: customer Table

DESC customer;

-- If customer has a city_name column, it violates 3NF because city_name depends on city_id, not customer_id.

--  Remove city_name from customer and join it via city_id.

## 4. Normalization Process
#Q4. Take a specific table in Sakila and normalize it up to at least 2NF.

-- Example: rental table normalization.
--  If rental stored customer_address, move it to customer table.
-- Ensure rental only stores customer_id, inventory_id, and rental_date.

## 5. CTE Basics
#Q5. Write a query using a CTE to retrieve the distinct list of actor names and the number of films they have acted in.
WITH ActorFilms AS (
    SELECT actor.actor_id, actor.first_name, actor.last_name, COUNT(film_actor.film_id) AS film_count
    FROM actor
    JOIN film_actor ON actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
    GROUP BY actor.actor_id
)
SELECT * FROM ActorFilms;


## 6. CTE with Joins
#Q6. Create a CTE that combines information from film and language tables to display the film title, language name, and rental rate.

WITH FilmDetails AS (
    SELECT film.title, language.name AS language_name, film.rental_rate
    FROM film
    JOIN language ON film.language_id = language.language_id
)
SELECT * FROM FilmDetails;

##7. CTE for Aggregation
#Q7. Write a query using a CTE to find the total revenue generated by each customer.

WITH CustomerRevenue AS (
    SELECT customer.customer_id, customer.first_name, customer.last_name, SUM(payment.amount) AS total_revenue
    FROM customer
    JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id = payment.customer_id
    GROUP BY customer.customer_id
)
SELECT * FROM CustomerRevenue ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

## 8. CTE with Window Functions
#Q8. Utilize a CTE with a window function to rank films based on rental duration.


WITH FilmRanking AS (
    SELECT film_id, title, rental_duration,
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY rental_duration DESC) AS rank_position
    FROM film
)
SELECT * FROM FilmRanking;

## 9. CTE and Filtering
#Q9. Create a CTE to list customers who have made more than two rentals and join it with the customer table for additional details.

WITH FrequentRenters AS (
    SELECT customer_id, COUNT(rental_id) AS rental_count
    FROM rental
    GROUP BY customer_id
    HAVING COUNT(rental_id) > 2
)
SELECT customer.first_name, customer.last_name, customer.email, FrequentRenters.rental_count
FROM customer
JOIN FrequentRenters ON customer.customer_id = FrequentRenters.customer_id;

## 10. CTE for Date Calculations
#Q10. Write a query using a CTE to find the total number of rentals made each month.

WITH MonthlyRentals AS (
    SELECT MONTH(rental_date) AS rental_month, COUNT(rental_id) AS total_rentals
    FROM rental
    GROUP BY rental_month
)
SELECT * FROM MonthlyRentals;

## 11. CTE and Self-Join
#Q11. Create a CTE to generate a report showing pairs of actors who have appeared in the same film together.

WITH ActorPairs AS (
